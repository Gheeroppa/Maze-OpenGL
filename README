1. INTRODUZIONE
----------------------------
The project was implemented using only graphic libraries
OpenGL and FreeGlut and the OpenAL audio library.

The application is a minigame with a first-person view, where the goal is
collect the totality of golden cases, randomly scattered within one
closed maze, in the shortest possible time.



2. MAZE GENERATION
----------------------------
The three-dimensional maze, by default, consists of 65 * 65 boxes.
Each box can be either an empty cell, where it is possible to walk, or
a full cell, that is formed by an impenetrable wall.

The empty boxes have a unique texture on the underside of the cube
simulates the path that can be walked on.
Instead, the full boxes are completely texturized.
To simulate the sky, a skybox was used, a cube of
considerable size compared to the labyrinth cells and textured with a
starry sky.

The labyrinth has no rooms but only corridors and is perimetrically
closed.

For the maze creation a recursive algorithm was used.
a matrix of size 65 * 65 is initialized to all ones (only walls).
Partnedo from an initial box, you can visit an adjacent cell in a random 
direction and recursively recalls the algorithm depending on whether it 
is concurrent with walls or empty cells, remaining within the perimeter.
(See sources)



3. GAME SYSTEM
----------------------------
The character, interpreted only by the camera, moves
forward and backward and rotate the view clockwise and counterclockwise with 
the corresponding keys: W-S-D-A.
In conjunction with the camera there is a spotlight light to simulate
the use of a torch, a directional light with a reduced radial opening cone.

To collect the golden boxes you need to be in a short space around them and press 
the SPACE key. Auditory feedback is present at the collection.

Instructions of the movements, remaining boxes and score are displayed in the
"Title Window".

The score is calculated based on the collection time of the speakers (positioned
randomly during the initial rendering phase).
A winning message will appear to collect all the boxes.
